  <p>India started the precautionary dose, also known as the Booster Dose, when coronavirus infections in the country were once again on a steep upward trajectory. The Precautionary Dose is the third dose of vaccine given to people with compromised immune systems despite receiving the first two doses. Its goal is to strengthen the magnitude of protection by producing more antibodies. As of February 2022, the precautionary dose is for healthcare workers, frontline workers and senior citizens. There is no need for new registration for those eligible for the Precautionary Dose or the third dose of covid vaccine. Also, there no mixing of vaccines shall be done for the Booster Dose. Those who received two doses of Covishield (manufactured by Serum Institute of India) will receive the same vaccine as the third dose. The same goes for Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech International Ltd) and Sputnik.</p>
